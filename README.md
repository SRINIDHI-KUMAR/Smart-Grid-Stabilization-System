# ⚡ AI based Smart Grid Stabilization and Autonomous Control System

An **AI-based Smart Grid Stabilizing and autonomous control system** that predicts renewable energy generation (solar & wind), analyzes electricity demand, and automatically decides grid actions such as battery usage, EV charging policy, and dynamic energy pricing.

The system combines **machine learning models (XGBoost)** with a **real-time interactive dashboard** to demonstrate how modern smart grids can balance supply and demand.

---

# 🧠 System Overview

The project simulates a **24-hour energy grid** using multiple realistic scenarios.

Renewable energy generation is predicted using trained ML models and the grid controller dynamically reacts to energy imbalances.

### Grid Decisions Include

* Battery charging / discharging
* Power rerouting
* Emergency grid stabilization
* EV charging policy adjustment
* Dynamic electricity pricing

---

# ⚙️ Features

### ⚡ Renewable Energy Prediction

* Solar power prediction using **XGBoost**
* Wind power prediction using **XGBoost**
* Uses environmental features such as:

  * Solar irradiance
  * Cloud cover
  * Temperature
  * Wind speed
  * Wind direction
  * Air density

### 🔋 Smart Battery Management

Battery automatically responds to grid imbalance:

| Condition        | Action                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Supply >> Demand | Store energy in battery |
| Balanced grid    | No action               |
| Supply < Demand  | Use backup battery      |
| Severe deficit   | Emergency support       |

---

### 🚗 EV Charging Intelligence

The grid dynamically controls EV charging based on grid conditions:

* ⚡ Fast Charging (surplus energy)
* 🚗 Normal Charging
* ⚠ Limited Charging
* 🛑 Charging Paused during emergency

---

### 💰 Dynamic Pricing

Electricity price multiplier adjusts automatically:

| Grid Condition | Price             |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Surplus energy | Cheap electricity |
| Balanced grid  | Normal price      |
| Energy deficit | High price        |

---

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard

The web dashboard provides:

* Real-time KPIs
* Supply vs demand charts
* Renewable energy generation graphs
* Battery status visualization
* EV charging policy display
* Grid action alerts
* 24-hour simulation log
* Raw ML model input features

---

# 🧩 Grid Simulation Patterns

Each simulation run cycles through **7 grid scenarios**:

| Pattern   | Scenario                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Pattern 1 | Supply < Demand (battery backup) |
| Pattern 2 | Supply > Demand (energy storage) |
| Pattern 3 | Balanced grid                    |
| Pattern 4 | Extreme demand spike             |
| Pattern 5 | High EV charging load            |
| Pattern 6 | Night wind surplus               |
| Pattern 7 | Full day ramp (mixed conditions) |
